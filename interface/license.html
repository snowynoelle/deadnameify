    <h1>GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</h1>
    <h2>Version 1, February 1989</h2>
    
    <p>Copyright (C) 1989 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <br>
    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>
    
    <h2>PREAMBLE</h2>
    
    <p>The GNU General Public License is a free software license for software and other kinds of works. The general
    terms and conditions are intended to ensure that the software remains free for all users and that everyone
    has the freedom to share, modify, and distribute it. This license applies to software programs and related
    documentation that are covered by it, but not to works that are only distributed with or linked to such programs.</p>
    
    <p>1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Program.</p>

    <p>2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</li>
        <li>You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.</li>
        <li>If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, to be conspicuously marked with the phrase "no warranty"), and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or modified versions of the Program) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above, provided that you also do one of the following:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Accompany it with the corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or</li>
        <li>Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.</p>

    <p>5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.</p>

    <p>6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.</p>

    <p>7. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the license, you may choose any version of the License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.</p>

    <p>8. If you wish to incorporate parts of this Program into other free software that is not already covered by this License, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA. We sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.</p>

    <p>NO WARRANTY</p>
    
    <p>9. Because the Program is licensed free of charge, there is no warranty for the Program, to the extent permitted by applicable law. Except when otherwise stated in writing, the copyright holders and/or other parties provide the Program "as is" without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Program is with you. Should the Program prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correction.</p>

    <p>10. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>

    <p>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>
